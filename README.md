# Numbers file

The numbersfile.py file includes functions for file processing. It has functions for writing items from a list to a file, reading specific lines from a file and removing the file.

## Getting Started

The scripts are implemented using Python 3.6.0.

To conduct an example run of the implemented functions, navigate to the NumbersFile folder and run the following command on the command line. 
 
 ```python numbersfile.py```

The example run prints name of the file and items from the lines 1-50.

## Running the tests

The implementation also includes a unittest script that can be used to test that the file processing has succeeded. To run the tests, use the following command on the command line.

```python -m unittest discover```
